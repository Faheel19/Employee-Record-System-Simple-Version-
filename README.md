# Employee Record System (Simple-Version)

# Introduction
This program is a simple record management program for a company for its employees. It adds add, delete, searches, lists employee data
# Data Structures  
The program uses one data structure which is a struct. Most of the program is depended on the switch statement though.
# Functions
Void gotxy(); moves the cursor in the specified location
Void login() : ask the user a username and password
# The Main Program 
In this program the main program does most of the work. We have a struct declared with variables and open a file to be used which is emp.txt. Afterwards we create a while loop which has a switch statement so that the program can keep looping. In the switch statements we do different cases such as add records, delete records, search records, list records and quit the system. All of these changes affects the emp.txt file directly. 

# **"Don’t delete the file name “EMP.txt” as it contains the records of the program and is necessary for it to run"**
